		Organic and natural ingredients
		Once a niche market, handmade and certified organic products
		are becoming more mainstream. Even though many cosmetic products are regulated,
		health concerns persist regarding the presence of harmful chemicals in these products.
		Aside from color additives, cosmetic products and their ingredients are not subject to regulation 
		prior to their release on the market. Many new products are released every season, often after only slight testing.
		Many cosmetic companies claim toproduce "all natural" and "organic" products, such as anti-ageing and anti-acne creams based on
		Egg Oil which contains Omega-3 fatty acids and xanthophylls. All natural products contain mineral, egg and plant ingredients, and organic 
		products are made with organic agricultural products. Products claimed to be organic should be certified "USDA Organic".
		Mineral makeup
		The term "mineral makeup" applies to a category of face makeup, 
		including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry 
		mineral powders. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as 
		compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are also often called mineral makeup 
		if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain 
		preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.</div>

		Ingredients
		The main ingredients in mineral makeups are usually coverage pigments, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, both of which are also physical sunscreens.
		Other main ingredients include mica (Sericite) and pigmenting minerals, such as iron oxide, tin oxide, and magnesium myristate.
		Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, many dermatologists 
		consider mineral makeup to be purer and kinder to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients. However, some mineral makeups contain Bismuth oxychloride,
		which can be irritating to the skin of sensitive individuals. Others also contain talc, over which there is some controversy because of its comedogenic tendencies 
		(tendency to clog pores and therefore cause acne) and because some people are sensitive to talc.

		The manufacture of cosmetics is currently dominated by a small number of multinational corporations that originated in the early 20th century, 
		but the distribution and sale of cosmetics is spread among a wide range of different businesses. The worlds largest cosmetic companies are The L'Oréal Group, 
		The Procter & Gamble Company, Unilever, Shiseido Company, Limited and Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.The market volume of the cosmetics industry in the US, Europe, 
		and Japan is about EUR 70B/y, according to a 2005 publication. In Germany, the cosmetic industry generated EUR 12.6 billion of retail sales in 2008, which makes the German 
		cosmetic industry the third largest in the world, after Japan and the United States. It has been shown that in Germany this industry grew nearly 5 percent in one year, from 2007 
		to 2008. German exportsin this industry reached EUR 5.8 billion in 2008, whereas imports of cosmetics totaled EUR 3 billion. The main countries that export cosmetics to Germany are 
		France, Switzerland, the United States and Italy, and they mainly consist of makeup and fragrances or perfumes for women.

		The worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated annual 
		turnover of US$170 billion (according to Eurostaf - May 2007). Europe is the leading market, representing 
		approximately €63 billion, while sales in France reached €6.5 billion in 2006, according to FIPAR (Fédération des Industries de la 
		Parfumerie - the French federation for the perfume industry). France is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an important role, 
		both nationally and internationally. Most products with a label, "Made in France" are valued on the international market. According to data from 2008, 
		the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in France for 40 consecutive years. In 2006, this industrial sector reached a record level of EUR 6.5 billion. 
		Famous cosmetic brands produced in France include Vichy, Yves Saint Laurent, Yves Rocher and many others.

		Benefits
		Because titanium dioxide and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties, mineral makeups with those ingredients can also have a calming effect on the skin,
		which is particularly important for those who suffer from inflammatory problems such as rosacea. Zinc oxide is also anti-microbial, so mineral makeups can be beneficial for people with acne.
		Mineral makeup is noncomedogenic (as long as it does not contain talc) and offers a mild amount of sun protection (because of the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide), 
		Because they do not contain liquid ingredients, mineral makeups can last in their containers indefinitely as long as the user does not contaminate them with other liquid or fingertips.
